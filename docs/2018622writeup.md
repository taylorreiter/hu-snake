# Hu Bin Crumbs

By Taylor Reiter

## Background

Hu et al. 2016 undertook metagenomic analysis of microbial communities in oil reservoirs located in the Alaska North Slope. Methane production and carbon turnover (the return of carbon fixed by photosynthesis to atmospheric carbon dioxide) are two major biogeochemical transitions that occur in oil reservoirs. We focused our analysis on the Hu et al. SB1 sample, sampled from the Schrader Bluff Formation. Oil from this sample was the most degraded of all those sampled from the Alaska North Slope (Piceno et al. 2014), and the sample was not "soured" (via microbial hydrogen sulfide production).

## Methods overview

Of the 61 bins generated for sample SB1, we performed queries with 22 bins approximately 100% present in the SB1 metagenomic sample. We also performed queries from eight bins binned from SB2 which were also approximately 100% present in the SB1 metagenomic sample. After querying, we subtracted the bin used to perform the query (producing a *donut*), and then subtracted any sequence binned from any of the six Hu et al. metagenomic samples (producing *crumbs*). We refer to these sequences as unitig donuts and unitig crumbs, respectively. We next extracted any read that contained at least 10% of k-mers found in these unitigs and assembled these reads, producing donut assemblies and crumb assemblies. We analyzed \*unitigs and \*crumbs for functional and taxonomic content. We used prokka to find hypothetical protein coding domains in the unitigs and assemblies, and KEGG GhostKOALA for protein and taxonomic annotation. This write up focuses on the crumb assemblies.

## Results & Discussion

### General points

#### Neighborhood queries increase genome completeness

#### Something something, completeness correlates with something crumbly bumbly

### Taxonomic classification

#### Some neighborhood queries contain important marker genes

Nine crumb assemblies contained one of three marker genes used for taxonomic classification by Hu et al.: *gyrA* (12 observations), *gyrB* (eight observations), or *recA* (one observation) (**Table 1**). Because some queries were closely related, three marker gene sequences occurred in two crumb assemblies. To investigate the marker genes further, we BLASTed both the nucleotide and amino acid sequences against the NCBI nr/nt database (06/25/18), which includes the genome bins from Hu et al. We were curious whether the taxonomic assignment of the marker genes found in the crumb assemblies agreed with the assignment of the Hu bins, and whether the sequences identified in the crumb assemblies matched closely to other sequences in the Hu bins.

\* crumb assembly overlap

In general, we noted that taxonomic assignment using the crumb assembly marker gene sequences agreed with that of Hu et al.

In three instances, we identified additional marker gene sequences for genes that were present in the bin. We investigated two of these sequences further to determine if the crumbs contained redundant information (high nucleotide identity). First, the *gyrA* sequence identified in hu-genome35 crumbs had high amino acid identity to that identified in the hu-genome35 bin (134/138; 97%), however there was no match at the nucleotide level (see blast matches in the supplement). The closest match at the nucleotide level was to *Draconibacterium orientale* strain FH5T. Given the high degree of amino acid similarity between the binned sequence and the sequence in the crumb, this may reflect strain variation within the population. 

Second, the *gyrA* sequence in the crumb assemblies of hu-genome02 and hu-genome30 was identical, and a *gyrA* sequence was previously identified in the hu-genome02 bin. The closest amino acid match was to *Methanomicrobiales archaeon* (identities 102/111, 92%; e-value 4e-59), and there was no match to any Hu bins. The *M. archaeon* sequence was binned from a metagenome, and the organisms falls in an unclassified taxonomic class within order *Methanomicrobiales*, the order to which *Methanoculleus marisnigri* belongs. The closest nucleotide match was to *M. marisnigri* JR1 (identities 307/331, 93%, e-value 2e-134), and there was no match to any of the Hu bins. *M. marisnigri* JR1 was sequenced from an isolate. (BLAST alignments located in the supplement)

The crumb assembly from hu-genome36 had an especially strong match to *gyrA* (score 628), and so we investigated this sequence further. At the amino acid level, the closest match was to the hu-genome36 bin (identity 96%) (BLAST alignments located in supplement). However, the closest match to the nucleotide sequence was *Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum*, and the next best match was *Desulfotomaculum kuznetsovii*. *Pelotomaulum* and *Desulfotomaculum* are from the same family, *Peptococcaceae*. Again, this may indicate the presence of strain variation within the sample.

We also recovered marker genes from the crumb assembly of hu-genome38, a near-complete genome from a candidate phlya binned by Hu et al. The top amino acid hit was to the hu-genome38 bin *Parcubacteria bacterium* (identity 92%). Most other protein matches were to candidate phlya. The best nucleotide match was to *Sneathia amnii* strain SN35 with 70% identity, however *S. amnii* appears to be binned from a metagenome.

From the sequences we investigated, many had high amino acid identity to sequences in Hu et al. bins, however the nucleotide sequences were sufficiently different to return no match within the top 100 matches in a BLAST against the nt database. However, this was not always true, as in some cases there was no match at the amino acid level to the Hu bin.


#### Taxonomic signal from non-marker genes

We also investigated the taxonomic signal of non-marker genes in the crumb assemblies using GhostKOALA. We noted three trends. First, the taxonomic signal from archaeal crumb assemblies is accurate and consistent for predicted genes. The majority of genes were annotated at the correct genus level. There were a handful of genes in each crumb assembly that were annotated as a different genus of methanogenic archaea or as bacteria, however closer inspection of the bacterial annotations revealed that although there was no strong match in KEGG, archaeal sequence was a better match than bacterial sequence when BLASTed against RefSeq (**figure 1**). This may reflect horizontal gene transfer, however we did not investigate this hypothesis further (e.g. via site rate heterogeneity tests). 

![An example of the taxonomic signal from the amino acid sequences of predicted genes hu-genome02 crumb assembly. hu-genome02 bin was classed as *Methanoculleus marisnigri*. We performed taxonomic classification with KEGG GhostKOALA.](figures/hu-genome02.png)

Second, the taxonomic signal for predicted genes in bacterial crumb assemblies did not agree with bin assignments at the genus level. 

The second most abundant annotation for predicted genes in the crumb assemblies matched the genus assignment for hu-genome14, hu-genome29, and hu-genome36 (all *Desulfutomaculum*). *Pelotomaculum*, a genus in the same order as *Desulfotomaculum*, was the best match (**figure 2**). This trend, combined with the *gyrA* nucleotide match above, may indicate that the organism in these bins is more closely related to *Pelotomaculum* than to *Desulfutomaculum*, or that genus-level assignment is not possible given current taxonomic information. 

![An example of the taxonomic signal from the amino acid sequences of predicted genes hu-genome29 crumb assembly. hu-genome29 bin was classed as *Desulfotomaculum sp.*, though the most abundant prediction was for genus *Pelotomaculum*. We performed taxonomic classification with KEGG GhostKOALA.](figures/hu-genome29.png)

The same pattern was observed for the crumb assemblies of hu-genome25 and hu-genome40. These bins were annotated as class *Anaerolineae*, however a genus within this class was the second most abundant taxonomic annotation. The most abundant was *Brevibacterium*, which is in a different phylum than *Anaerolineae* (*Actinobacteria* vs. *Chloroflexi*). 

hu-genome03, hu-genome12, hu-genome31, and hu-genome33 were classified to the order *Synergistales*, however all four had strong matches to the genus *Thermovirga*, a genus within order *Synergistales*. 

Third, we observed that the taxonomic signal is clear at the kingdom level for predicted genes in crumb assemblies of candidate and unknown bins. This was true for hu-genome10, hu-genome13, hu-genome21, hu-genome27, hu-genome28, hu-genome34, hu-genome35, hu-genome37, and hu-genome38, all of which were candidate phyla (**figure 3**). No candidate phyla had a strong taxonomic signal, supporting their assignment into new taxonomic classifications. We observed a similar weak taxonomic signal for hu-genome23 and hu-genome39 which were not candidate phyla. 

![An example of the taxonomic signal from the amino acid sequences of predicted genes hu-genome34 crumb assembly. hu-genome34 bin was classed as *Atribacteria bacterium*, a candidate phlya. We performed taxonomic classification with KEGG GhostKOALA.](figures/hu-genome34.png)
	
### Functional characterization

#### Crumbs are enriched for metabolic genes

We performed a KEGG enrichment analysis on the genes found in the crumb assemblies. Only metabolic genes were significantly enriched for, with the exception of Ribosomal genes (**figure 4**). This contrasts to "informational" genes which are involved in replication, translation, and transcription of nucleotides. This may indicate that we recover more accessory genes, i.e. genes in the pangenome, instead of core genes in the crumb assemblies, but I'm not sure how to test this right now.

![KEGG enrichment analysis of genes found in the crumb assemblies confidently annotated by KEGG GhostKOALA (>= 100). Carbon metabolism and methane metabolism are important for biogeochemical transformations in oil reservoirs. ](figures/crumb-dotplot-score100.png)

#### Crumbs contain predicted genes with biologically important roles

There's lots of stuff!Bacteria and archaea seem to contribute approximately equal amounts of functional content from crumb assemblies (**figure 5**). Carbon metabolism was the second most abundant BRITE hierarchy category, which likely reflects the degraded state of this reservoir, as reported by Piceno et al. 2014.   

![KEGG ortholog BRITE hierarchy categories for prokka-predicted, GhostKOALA annotated proteins in the crumb assemblies. Cut off score 100.](figures/kegg-all-col-kingdom.png)

There are also predicted genes that are important to the biology of the oil reservoir. Methane production and carbon degradation are important in oil reservoirs, and these are abundantly predicted in the crumb assemblies (**figure 6**).
 
![Presence of biologically important genes, as defined in An et al. 2013. Methanogenic processes were most abundant, while dearomatization processes were second. All processes were anaerobic.](figures/an_ass.png)

#### Nitrogenase genes

Our approach also built upon observations of nitrogenase genes identified by Hu et al. We observed five additional nitrogenase gene sequences coding for portions of *nifH*, *glnB*, and *nifE*. All are located in crumbs of bins previously identified as containing nitrogen fixation genes. Both hu-genome24 and gu-genome02/30 contained a first observation of *glnB*, a nitrogen metabolism regulatory protein not previously observed in the SB1 sample but observed in a methanogenic archaea from the K3 sample. These observations support the Hu et al. conclusion that the majority of nitrogen fixation genes occur in methanogenic *Archaea* as opposed to *Bacteria*, in contrast to most other ecosystems.

*N. F. = Nitrogen Fixation
** overlap in crumbs, same observation as *glnB* in hu-genome02 crumbs.

#### Predicted crumb gene sequences have low homology to predicted bin gene sequences

As can be observed with the *gyrA* alignments, there is sometimes high amino acid identity with proteins that found in the bins, but there is not high nucleotide identity.
